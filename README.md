Node Feedback
======================

Node Feedback shows a form, in a block you can place on a node condition layout,
to collect feedback from users for a given node type entry. That form runs on
ajax so the user doesn't have to leave the page.

Each node has its own feedbacks list to review. There is also an admin report
for all node feedbacks.
